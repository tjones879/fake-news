This repository is in fulfillment of the final project for CSCI 486 - Artificial Intelligence

Included are a series of IPython notebooks that detail the
process that was taken to discover the viability of a "fake-news"
classifier. These scripts use [scikit-learn]() for developing
the models for classification, and [Open Sources]() was the primary
dataset that articles were obtained from.

Start at Initial Modeling.
